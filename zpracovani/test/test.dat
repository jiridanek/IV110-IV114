UNIQUE-ID - BCCP-CPLX

TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - biotin carboxyl carrier protein (dimer)
CITATIONS - [10542197]
CITATIONS - 14594796
COMMENT - Biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) plays a central role
/in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex. The overall carboxylase
/reaction takes place in two distinct half-reactions.  BCCP, which
/contains a biotinyl prosthetic group covalently attached to a specific
/lysyl residue, is carboxylated in the first partial reaction.  In the
/second partial reaction the carboxyl group is transferred to an
/acceptor and BCCP is regenerated for further carboxylation |CITS:
/[324999]|.
/On the other hand, BCCP amino terminal is able to bind to DNA; this means, BCCP autoregulates its coding 
/gene expression (the accBD operon) |CITS:[14594796]|.

TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - MazE-MazF antitoxin/toxin complex and DNA-binding transcriptional repressor
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3278872660:pkarp
COMMENT - MazF is a toxin that is counteracted by the MazE antitoxin |CITS: [8650219]|.  The mazEF system causes a "programmed cell death" response to stresses including starvation |CITS: [8650219]| and antibiotics |CITS: [11222603]|. The antitoxin, MazE, is subject to degradation by ClpP-ClpA protease complex and exhibits a short (30 minute) half life, whereas the toxin, MazF, is much more stable |CITS: [8650219]|.  
/
/The structure of the MazE-MazF complex is presented at 1.7 A resolution |CITS: [12718874]|.  The complex is hexameric and is comprised of a MazE homodimer sandwiched between MazF homodimers |CITS: [12718874]|.
